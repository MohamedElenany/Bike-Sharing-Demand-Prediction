# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
## Main Objective
The primary objective of this comprehensive project is to conduct a regression task for predicting the hourly demand of a bikesharing system in Seoul. This regression model aims to provide accurate forecasts of demand, contributing to the optimization of the bikesharing service. Additionally, the project encompasses the utilization of causal inference techniques to discern the main causalities behind fluctuations in demand. By combining regression and causal inference, the goal is to not only predict demand patterns but also unravel the underlying factors and relationships influencing the demand for rental bikes on an hourly basis. The ultimate aim is to enhance the availability and accessibility of bikes, minimizing waiting times for users and ensuring a responsive supply that aligns with the dynamic needs of the urban environment.

## Project Steps
### Data Pre-processing
1. **Data Structure Analysis:** Conducted an in-depth exploration of dataset statistics and distributions to form a foundational understanding of the underlying data structure.
2. **Data Visualization for Insights:** Performed comprehensive correlation studies and experimented with diverse attribute combinations to uncover nuanced relationships within the dataset.
3. **Preparing Data:** Executed rigorous data preparation, involving handling missing data, one-hot encoding categorical features, addressing multicollinearity through VIF testing, detecting and removing outliers using isolation forests. Additionally, I applied feature scaling using Standard Scaler and MinMax Scaler to ensure compatibility with machine learning models, and employed feature selection utilizing LASSO to mitigate noise in the data and enhance the predictive power of the models.

### Models used for Regression
Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor underwent thorough training and evaluation via cross-validation. The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best performer, showcasing superior predictive accuracy. On the other hand, the Decision Tree Regressor exhibited a tendency to overfit the training data, leading to suboptimal generalization. Notably, Linear Regression was identified as the least performer among the models, highlighting its limitations in capturing the complexity of the underlying patterns in the dataset. For the Random Forest Regressor, the hyperparameter tuning process involved fine-tuning parameters such as max_depth, min_samples_leaf, min_samples_split, and n_estimators using a combination of Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV. This meticulous approach aimed to optimize the model's performance and strike a balance between predictive accuracy and generalization to unseen data, ultimately solidifying its position as the most promising model.

### Causal Inference
Adopted advanced causal inference techniques using Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM) and XGBoost with diverse meta-learners (S, T, and X). The treatment, identified as hot weather, was examined to understand its causal relationship with the hourly demand for bikes. Model performances were evaluated based on AUUC scores, ultimately leading to the selection of the T-learner with LGBM as the optimal model for predicting the causal impact of hot weather on bike demand.

## Results
- **Regression Model:** The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most proficient model for predicting hourly bike demand by having the lowest test set Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Causal Inference Model:** The T-learner with LGBM achieved the highest AUUC score, providing a nuanced understanding of the causal relationship between hot weather and bikesharing demand.
  
## Causal Inference Insights:
The application of causal inference techniques, particularly the T-learner with LGBM, has provided nuanced insights into the causal relationship between hot weather and bikesharing demand. The analysis revealed an Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of 512, indicating a substantial increase in hourly bike demand during hot weather. The top predictive features identified during feature importance analysis in hot weather include Solar Radiation, Autumn, Humidity, and Spring. Shap Values analysis offered detailed insights into feature importance. Taking the example of 'Solar Radiation,' lower levels were associated with a negative Shap value, indicating a decrease in demand. Conversely, higher radiation levels corresponding to hotter weather yielded a positive Shap value, suggesting an increase in demand due to the rise in solar radiation. This example illustrates how Shap Values provide a nuanced understanding of how specific weather conditions impact bikesharing demand during different temperatures. These causal inference insights offer valuable input for strategic decision-making, providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing bikesharing demand.

## Business Value and Applicability
This combined regression and causal inference project delivers significant value by offering profound insights into the factors influencing bikesharing demand. The regression model provides precise demand predictions, while the causal inference results unravel the nuanced impact of weather temperature on bike usage. These insights empower strategic decision-making in areas such as marketing, service optimization, and infrastructure planning, contributing to an enhanced user experience and operational efficiency. The findings of this project directly benefit bikesharing service providers, urban planners, and policymakers. The comprehensive understanding of demand factors enables proactive management, ensuring an optimal supply of bikes during peak hours and favorable weather conditions. These insights contribute to the development of a more responsive, efficient, and user-centric bikesharing system, aligning seamlessly with the evolving needs of the urban community.
